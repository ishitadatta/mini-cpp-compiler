# Mini C++ Compiler showing if-else, for loop

Our problem statement is to design and implement a compiler for a simple programming 
C++-like language using the Lex and Yacc compiler generating packages and a simple GUI 
using C++. 

This project being a Mini Compiler for the C++ programming language focuses on
generating an intermediate code for the language for specific constructs. It works for
constructs such as conditional statements, loops, and the ternary operator. The main 
functionality of the project is to generate an optimized intermediate code for the given C++ 
source code. This is done using the following steps:

* Generate symbol table after performing expression evaluation 
* Generate Abstract Syntax Tree for the code 
* Generate 3 address code followed by corresponding quadruples 
* Perform Code Optimization 

<p> The main tools used in the project include LEX which identifies predefined 
patterns and generates tokens for the patterns matched and YACC which parses the input 
for semantic meaning and generates an abstract syntax tree and intermediate code for the 
source code. PYTHON is used to optimize the intermediate code generated by the parser. </p>
